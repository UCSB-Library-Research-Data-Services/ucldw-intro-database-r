# Integrating SQL into R analytical workflows using duckDB & dbplyr 


### Summary

In this workshop, we will discuss why you might consider relational databases to store environmental data. We will go over how to insert data in and retrieve data from a database using R and [duckDB](https://duckdb.org/). We will focus on how to use the R [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) package to integrate databases into tidyverse-focused analytical workflows.

This workshop will cover these main points:  

- Introduce concepts of a database and discuss why you might want to have/want to use one
- How to integrate the use of a database into an R analytical workflow
- Hands-on exercise using [duckDB](https://duckdb.org/), [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) and how it can be used to learn some SQL basics
